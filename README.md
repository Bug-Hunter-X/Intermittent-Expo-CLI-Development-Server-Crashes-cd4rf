# Intermittent Expo CLI Development Server Crashes

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo CLI development server crashes randomly without providing clear error messages in the terminal. This issue disrupts the development workflow and causes unexpected disconnections from the Expo Go app.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `expo start` to start the development server.
4. Observe that after some time, the server may crash without any informative error messages.

## Potential Causes

* **Memory Leaks:**  The application or Expo CLI might have memory leaks leading to instability and crashes.
* **Asynchronous Operations:** Unhandled exceptions in asynchronous operations might cause the server to terminate unexpectedly.
* **Third-Party Library Conflicts:** Conflicts with third-party libraries used in the project could contribute to the issue.

## Solution

The provided solution involves enhanced error handling and a more robust approach to managing asynchronous tasks within the application.
